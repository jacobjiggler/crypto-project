     Note: Because of the use of to_string and of the ezpwd library, this program must be compiled with C++11. Please add the -std=c++11 compiler flag.

     To install Crypto++ on Ubuntu:
     	sudo apt-get install libcrypto++9 libcrypto++9-dbg libcrypto++-dev

      The proxy is a little buggy and will crash, especially if it can't get it's port by the time an atm connects to it. Waiting and rerunning it a few seconds later should fix any issues it has.
